# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Known security limits (beta)

Miasma is beta software and has not been externally audited. Read these limits
before relying on it:

- The protocol is beta and externally unaudited. Do not use it for material
  whose exposure would be serious.
- MID + password protect the confidentiality of file content. The MID does not
  bind whether a file is password-protected, nor which publication of it a
  record refers to (no publication generation).
- DHT records are not authenticated to the publisher: anyone who knows a MID
  can publish a competing record for it. The final whole-file MID check stops
  an attacker from substituting different content, but availability can still
  be attacked (a receiver can be pointed at unavailable or junk locations).
- Hosted-share storage (keeping shares for other peers) is opt-in; the default
  quota is 0.
- The obfuscated QUIC and REALITY transports do not authenticate the server and
  do not resist replay. Do not rely on them for resistance to active probing or
  for confidentiality against an active interceptor. Content encryption still
  applies on top of them.
- Local control: the daemon's IPC and HTTP bridge require a random per-start
  token stored in `daemon.token` in the data directory. It is created owner-only
  on Unix (mode 0600). On Windows the daemon asks `icacls` to restrict the file
  to the current user and logs a warning, then continues, if that fails. Any
  process running as the same user can read the token and control the daemon;
  the token protects against other users and against unauthenticated loopback
  clients, not against malware in your own account. The bridge's `/api/ping`
  stays unauthenticated. Wipe needs a second, confirming request.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
